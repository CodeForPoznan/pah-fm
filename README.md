## How to use Make?

We use Make to make to manage running our project.
Run this command in terminal to see what Make commands are available:
```bash
make
```

## How to debug backend?
Run in terminal:
```bash
make debug-backend
```
After finishing debugging detach from shell using *CTRL*+`p` and *CTRL*+`q`.

## Initial admin credentials
We have 2 levels of admin users and 2 initial users - with and without Django Admin access:

username               | password | Django Admin access
---------------------- | -------- | -------------------
hello@codeforpoznan.pl | cfp123   | yes
ola@pah.org.pl         | pah123   | no

## Deployment
Dev deployment is done manually by Jacek @jacol12345 (or @jacekbj - same person, different alias).

Backend runs on Heroku free plan.
It is painfully slow and needs to warm up.
```
make deploy-backend-heroku
```

Frontend is deployed to Firebase:
```
make deploy-frontend-heroku
```
